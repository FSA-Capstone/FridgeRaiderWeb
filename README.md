# FridgeRaiderWeb
What's in your Fridge? 

Fridge Raider is a website which allows a user to enter ingredients and receive a list of recipes that they can make. 
The site was built with React, Redux, Node.js, Firebase, Mocha/Chai, Travis CI, Neo4j Graph DB, AWS S3, Heroku and Material UI.
Our goal was to create a fully featured site using the Neo4J graph database.
